# 🎮 FIBO XI DUNGEON V.1

## 📘 Game Manual / Explanation

**Overview:**  
*FIBO XI Dungeon* is a turn-based RPG where you play as an engineering student trapped in a surreal academic dungeon.  
Instead of a fixed time limit, the game runs as an endless loop as it's still in development but has a playable version 1.  
Your goal is to survive as long as possible. Each room presents different challenges, featuring FIBO's subject-themed boss battles and life-planning elements.  
Manage your HP and Mana, use items wisely, and upgrade your stats to stay alive. There is no escape — only endurance.

### 🎮 How to Play:
- Use `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` to move.
- Use `LShift` to run.
- Press `Space` to interact with objects.
- Engage in turn-based battles with subject-themed enemies.
- Access stats with `C` and exit additional popup with `Esc`.
- Upgrade your HP and Mana in the dorm room, at the wardrobe.

### 🧮 Scoring System:
- No traditional score — your progress is measured by:
  - Number of bosses defeated.
  - Days survived.
  - Stats progression and upgrades obtained.

### 📏 Rules:
- You lose a battle if your HP reaches 0, but you will revive with 50% of your max HP.
- All actions (interacting, fighting, resting) consume time.
- Skills consume different amounts of Mana depending on their power.
- Using normal attacks during battle helps restore Mana.
- You can only upgrade your stats when you're inside your dorm room.
- Defeating 5 bosses automatically starts a new day.
- Sleeping also triggers the start of a new day.
- Each day has 5 activity slots:
  - Fighting a boss consumes 1 slot.
  - Resting consumes 1 slot.
